    <h2>Tarin Wardwell</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Tarin Wardwell, I am currently a software engineering major and me and my husband have been recently married for about 5 months. I love hiking with my families dogs and spending my free time with my husband, family, and friends. I am currently unemployed but hope to one day become a full stack developer. I made a major change just this semester from becoming a dental hygenist to pursing Software engineering, so hopefully I like it :). The thing I love most about BYU-Idaho is the enviroment and accessibility. Me and my husband have been on campus for all our semesters so far until this one while he does a full time job in SWE for the church. I'm so grateful that we can still do school even though we're not on campus. I'm taking this course to hopefully learn about the design of websites and how to design websites, because I want to be able to have that skill set and know what I'm doing.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church my entire life and plan to raise my children in the church as well. The blessings I have recieved and seen in my life are amazing. I know for a fact that this church is true and that paying tithing, scripture study, prayer, etc are a huge part of my testimony. These do in fact seem repetative a lot of the time, but the faith I have doing these actions is what keeps me going and I know that heavenly father will bless me immensely throughout me and my husbands lives and our marrige.</p>
    <p>I'm so grateful to have the opportunity of being in this class and I'm so excited to work with all of you!</p>
